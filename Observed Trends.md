Observed Trends:

1)
  The item "Final Critic" was the most Popular and most Profitbale. The item was purchased a total of 13 times, for a total profit of $59.99.
  Developers of the game should recreate this item in another fashion to perhaps generate the same type of buzz. This item is clearly effective in user's gameplay
2)
  The 20-24 age is group is the most lucrative age group, as they grossed $1,114.06, the most profit of any other age group. A conclusion/assumption can be made that this age group is the sweet spot. Most people in this age group still have the excitment of video games as well as the income to pursue their gaming passions. As the age groups get older, the spending drop is significant. This can be seen in the Age Demogrpahics table where the volume of Totl Puchase Count drops from 258 to 77 between ages 20-24 and 24-29.
3)
  Potential Opportunity can be seen with the 15-19 age group. They lead come in second for age groups of volume of purchase count, 136, as seen from the Purchasing Analysis (Age) table. Understandably so, this age groups avg. purchasing price is low at $3.86 compared to the other age groups. But the volume of Purchase Count is second amongst the age group.
  Teenagers do not have a lot of money to spend as much as the other age groups, however the volumes tells us that they are very interested in the game. Game Developers should realize this and capitalize on the interest of this age demographic by offering more cheaper items that are not as effective in the game.
